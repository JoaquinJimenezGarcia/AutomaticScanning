# AutomaticScanning
Single bash script to automate simple proccess of scanning for an IP

This script takes two arguments: the destiny IP and the target name (choose want you want) and print the results in a folder (called "Results) with the name you gave it before.

This script is thought to use with an unique IP and not a range due to the commands it uses change some options for range and may not use if you specify a range instead a single IP.
